The optical bench for our Mass Simulator Model (MSM) is complete. This precision-machined aluminum structure forms the foundation of the telescope payload, and seeing it fully assembled marks a significant step toward vibration testing.

## Precision Manufacturing

The optical bench is machined from stainless steel to mimic the material properties of the final Invar telescope structure. Every mounting interface, bolt pattern, and structural feature has been verified against the flight design. The lightweighting pockets you see aren't just for mass reduction—they're carefully placed to maintain structural stiffness while minimizing weight.

## Component Integration

The bench includes mounting provisions for all major payload components: the primary mirror, focal plane array, and gyroscope. Each interface has been verified during our recent [fit check](/blog/fit-check), confirming that the assembly sequence works as planned.

## Design Details

The cross-shaped mounting structure provides rigid attachment points while the perimeter ring maintains optical alignment under load. This geometry was optimized through extensive finite element analysis to meet our stiffness and mass requirements.

## What's Next

With the optical bench complete, we're ready to proceed with full MSM integration and vibration testing. Data from these tests will validate our structural models and confirm that the design meets launch environment requirements.
