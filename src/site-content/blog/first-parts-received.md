Following our [Manufacturing Readiness Review](/blog/mass-simulator-manufacturing-readiness-review-complete) earlier this month, we've received the first batch of parts for the mass simulator build.

## Mock Mirrors

A key component of the mass simulator is the mock mirror set. These aren't optical-quality surfaces—they're mass and stiffness representatives designed to replicate the dynamic behavior of our flight mirrors during vibration testing.

The mock mirrors match the mass distribution and mounting interfaces of the flight design, giving us accurate modal response without the cost and lead time of optical fabrication.

## Assembly Fixtures

We also received assembly fixturing and hardware needed to begin testing our integration and assembly processes.

## What's Next

With parts in hand, we begin assembly rehearsals. This is where we validate our integration procedures and train the team before moving to flight hardware.
