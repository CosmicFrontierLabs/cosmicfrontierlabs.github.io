    We're looking for a firmware engineer to build the systems that control our telescopes—bridging high-level software and low-level electronics.

    You'll work on embedded systems, real-time control, and the interfaces between flight software and hardware. Experience with the NVIDIA Orin ecosystem is valuable. Rust experience is a plus. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing experience is a bonus.

    Intrinsic motivation matters most. If you care deeply about building reliable systems for space, we want to talk.

    We're looking for a test engineer to validate hardware and software across our telescope systems—making sure what we build actually works.

    You'll design and run tests, build test fixtures, write automation, and help us understand how our systems behave under real conditions. Experience with sensor characterization is a bonus—optical systems, gyros, thermal control loops, or similar.

    If you love finding edge cases and breaking things before they break themselves, we want to talk.

    Don't see your role listed? We're building something new, and we might need skills we haven't thought to ask for yet.

    Tell us what you do, why you're excited about abundant space telescopes, and what you'd bring to the mission.
