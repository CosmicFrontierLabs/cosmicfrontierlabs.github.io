    We’re looking for a systems engineer to own the end to end architecture of our telescope platform and keep the whole system coherent as it evolves.

    You will:  
    - Drive requirements, interfaces, and trade studies across optics, structures, thermal, avionics, and software
    - Own system budgets and margins (mass, power, pointing, thermal stability) and keep them honest as designs change
    - Plan verification and integration milestones so we learn fast without losing rigor

    In your first 90 days
    - Publish a v1 system budget with margin policy and the interfaces that matter most
    - Turn the next integration milestone into a concrete verification plan and test matrix
    - Unblock at least two cross discipline decisions with clear trades, rationale, and owners

    We’re looking for a thermal and structural modeling engineer to predict how our telescopes behave under launch loads and the extremes of orbit, and to turn those predictions into confident design decisions.
